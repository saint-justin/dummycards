# DummyCards

DummyCards is an open-source quick and dirty mockup tool to help facilitate the development of card and board games. There are three sets to using it.

1. Create your card template
2. Feed in your .csv file with all your card data
3. Export the cards in the style of your choice.

DummyCards is an open-source project. Feel free to use it, to contribute, to signal boost it, or anything like that. Don't claim that you made it, but pretty much anything else is fine. Feel free to make feature requests or bug reports through GitHub issues. We'll get to 'em eventually (probably).
